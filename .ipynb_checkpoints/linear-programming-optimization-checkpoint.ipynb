    "When facing financial constraints, it is important to use a strategic hiring approach. Six potential candidates are available, each offering different skills and requiring varying salary levels based on their part-time or full-time status and experience. The main goal is to find the most cost-effective mix of teachers who can collectively cover all the required subjects, thereby minimizing the monthly salary expenditure."
